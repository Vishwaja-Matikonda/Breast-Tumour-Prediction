Now-a-days breast cancer has become one of the leading cause of cancer death among women. This cancer is caused mostly due to the lifestyle changes, avoiding breast feeding etc. Detecting breast cancer takes long time due to manual diagnosis. Even though there are many diagnostic systems are available still, it takes more time for proper classification.For detecting breast cancer,machine learning techniques are used.

Applied SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes and Random Forest algorithms to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset from the UCI ML Repository (Kaggle)
• To predict whether the breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign.
• Compared the performance results of all the algorithms based on the accuracy and ROC values.
